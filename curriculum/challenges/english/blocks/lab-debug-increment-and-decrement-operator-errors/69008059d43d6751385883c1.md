# --description--

Your friend has asked you to help them debug their code. They are practicing increment and decrement operators but are getting unexpected results in the console.

Your task is to help them identify the mistakes and update the code so that the console outputs match the expected results.

You can refer back to the prior lessons on increment and decrement operators as well as prefix and postfix notation.
